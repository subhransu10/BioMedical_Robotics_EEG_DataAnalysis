## TASKS
The aim of the assignment is to load an EEG file (.set) on EEGLAB and using the GUI we must achieve the tasks mentioned below:
+  Using the GUI, complete the following steps:
a) Downsampling 250 Hz
b) Filtering [1-80Hz] + Notch filter 50 Hz
c) Epoching: Time locking event type: G interval: [-1 3]
+ Visual inspection for channels and epochs: Channel Data (scroll)
a) Remove bad epochs from the plot
b) Select bad channels and remove them using the GUI – Important: write
down the channels you removed
+ Independent Component Analyses
a) Run ICA (it takes some time…now it’s time to have a break!)
b) Manual Check of the components and mark the “bad” ones Reject Data
using ICA -> Reject components by map
+ Channels Interpolation
On the GUI select “Interpolate Electrodes” and “Use specific channels of other
dataset”
+ On the “clean” dataset Perform Average Reference
+ Run the spectra (Plot/Channels Spectra and Maps) on 100% of the data
adding one scalp map for each physiological frequency range (delta 1-4Hz,
theta 4-8Hz, alpha 8-13Hz, beta 15-25Hz)
